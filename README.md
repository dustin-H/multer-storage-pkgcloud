This is a multer storage plugin to upload files into a from pkgcloud supported cloud object storage.

It is just a storage plugin for multer. So you will need multer as well as pkgcloud to use this plugin. Please have a look at these two awesome projects:

- [multer](https://github.com/expressjs/multer)
- [pkgcloud](https://github.com/pkgcloud/pkgcloud#storage)

**IMPORTANT**: Multer version >= 1.0.0 required!
## API

#### Installation

`$ npm install multer-storage-pkgcloud`

NPM: [multer-storage-pkgcloud](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer-storage-pkgcloud)

#### Usage

Get the dependencies and create a pkgcloud client.
```js
var express = require('express')
var multer  = require('multer')
var pkgcloud = require('pkgcloud')
var pkgcloudStorage = require('multer-storage-pkgcloud')

var client = pkgcloud.storage.createClient({ /* pkgcloud config object */ })
// See pkgcloud documentation for more information
```

By default, file are stored in container named `uploads` and the name of the file is the `file.originalname`.

- options: `container`: Overwrite the container name.
- options: `destination`: Destination function which will be called for each file-upload to rename the container and/or the remote file.
See documentation of [multer](https://github.com/expressjs/multer) to get more information about the `file` object. The object passed to the callback `cb` is a option object from pkgcloud. See [pkgcloud/pkgcloud#file](https://github.com/pkgcloud/pkgcloud#file).

```js
var storage = pkgcloudStorage({
  client: client,
  destination: function (req, file, cb) {
    cb(null, {
      container: 'myContainer',
      remote: 'some/path/' + file.originalname
    })
  }
})
```

Then use the multer middleware in your express app. See [multer](https://github.com/expressjs/multer) for more detailed usage information of `upload`.
```js
var app = express();

var upload = multer({
  storage: storage
});

app.use('/', upload.single('fieldname1'));
app.use('/', upload.array('fieldname2', 12));
```
